# Installation

## Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding SpringFadeTabController as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/YourUserName/SpringFadeTabController.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

# Usage

After installing the library, import it wherever you want to use it:

```swift
import SpringFadeTabController
```

Set your UITabBarController to be a subclass of SpringFadeTabController.

```swift
class YourTabBarController: SpringFadeTabController {
    // Your code here
}
```

And that's it! Now, when you run your application, you should see the spring fade transition animation whenever you switch tabs.
